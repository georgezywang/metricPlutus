# metricPlutus
Metric Plutus is an econometric analysis on how COVID-19 hits different cities and its long term impact. This analysis primarily utilizes time series analysis forecasting and prediction based on a sequential neural network architecture.

## Abstract
We present a methodology for studying the economic impact of COVID-19 on cities under a consumer spending and business revenue perspective. We find in one year, places like Chicago will be most severely affected by COVID-19, followed by Los Angeles, while Charlotte is the least affected one among the cities we investigate. In general, we concluded that cities with lots of small industries and decreased population mobility are most severely affected.
